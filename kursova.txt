While growing up in North Bergen, New Jersey, Brooks endured a fractured family life and passed the time by
reading and writing. After dropping out of New York University, he got a job as an usher at CBS, going on to
write for the CBS News broadcasts. He moved to Los Angeles in 1965 to work on David L. Wolper's documentaries.
 After being laid off he met producer Allan Burns who secured him a job as a writer on the series My Mother the Car.
 Brooks wrote for several shows before being hired as a story editor on My Friend Tony and later created the series
 Room 222. Grant Tinker hired Brooks and Burns at MTM

 In the shorts and earlier episodes, Castellaneta voiced Homer with a loose
 impression of Walter Matthau; however, during the second and third seasons of the half-hour show,
 Homer's voice evolved to become more robust, to allow the expression of a fuller range of emotions.
 He has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons—including video games, The Simpsons Movie, T
 he Simpsons Ride, commercials, and comic books—and inspired an entire line of merchandise. His signature catchphrase, the annoyed grunt "D'oh!", has been included in The New Oxford Dictionary of English since 1998 and the
 Oxford English Dictionary since 2001.
